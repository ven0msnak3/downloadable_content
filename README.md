# System Management Projects
The 'System Management' refers to managing my system through automated solutions in Python Language.
Occasionally, I'll add some code with regards to other languages such as 'Go', 'Java', and 'C++' but most of my code will be
in Python.
Users are encouraged to download and work on my code and point out any flaws or anything I can do more efficiently.

What you're not allowed to do is to sell any of the code or make grandeous claims of being a genius programmer.

Other than weird, evil plans you might have, you're free to do whatever you like with the code.

***Also, Please NOTE that you're not allowed to distribute this code for any purpose whatever, you can however redirect your
friends and family who happen to be programmers to my page and have them make a withdrawal request from this repository directly***

Thank you for your support!
